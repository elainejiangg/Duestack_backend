Concept Design: 26 (out of 39)  
Comment: -3: Your User concept is not really achieving its purpose of authenticating users--there is no password or authenticating action.  
-1: Your canvasId state in your Courses concept is inaccessible since it is not initialized during createCourse and there are no actions that allow for it to be initialized.  
-6: You are missing many essential actions in your concepts. Consider any updating or deletion actions that you might want to have. Also consider any further actions you might want to perform.  
-1: Remember to define any generic types you are using in the concept definition.  
-5: You break modularity in your ParsedDeadlineSuggestions concept. Remember that concepts cannot see the implementation or state of other concept, so the ParsedDeadlineSuggestions concept has no way of parsing from an UploadedDocument directly! This concept is also not associated with any User, which means that it will be nearly impossible to find an instance of this for a given user.
