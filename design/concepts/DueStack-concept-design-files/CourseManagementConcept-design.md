# CourseManagementConcept Design Notes

## Implementation Changes

### No Major Changes
The CourseManagement concept was implemented exactly as specified in the original design. All actions and state components match the specification.

### Technical Implementation
- Used MongoDB collections with proper indexing for course lookups
- Implemented unique constraint validation for course codes per creator
- Added global uniqueness validation for Canvas IDs
- Proper error handling for all edge cases

### Testing Approach
- Comprehensive test coverage for all CRUD operations
- Validates uniqueness constraints at both creator and global levels
- Tests Canvas ID management and validation
- Covers error cases for non-existent courses

## Design Fidelity
This concept required no design changes during implementation.
