# UserIdentityConcept Design Notes

## Implementation Changes

### Added Actions
- **updateUserName**: Added to allow users to change their display name
- **updateUserEmail**: Added to allow users to change their email address with uniqueness validation

### Design Rationale
These additions were made to provide complete user profile management functionality as per feedback from TAs. The original specification only had user creation, but real applications need the ability to update user information.

### Technical Implementation
- Used MongoDB's `updateOne` with `$set` operator for efficient updates
- Maintained email uniqueness constraint across all updates
- Proper error handling for non-existent users

### Testing Approach
- Tests cover both successful updates and error cases
- Validates uniqueness constraints are maintained
- Ensures proper error messages for invalid operations

## No Major Design Changes
The core concept remained faithful to the original specification, with only additive enhancements for user profile management.
