# response:

To run the tests for the `UserConcept` in Deno, you should execute the following command in your terminal from the root of your repository:

```bash
deno test -A src/users/UserConcept.test.ts
```

* `deno test`: This command invokes Deno's built-in test runner.
* `-A`: This flag grants all permissions (network, file system, etc.) to the test runner. It's often used for convenience during development, but for production or more secure testing, you might want to specify granular permissions.
* `src/users/UserConcept.test.ts`: This is the path to your specific test file. If you wanted to run *all* tests in your project, you would simply omit the path and run `deno test -A`.
