# response:

Okay, I will update the `UserConcept.ts` and `UserConcept.test.ts` files to reflect the `UserIdentity` concept specification, including renaming files and updating the code to match the new concept name and structure.

First, I'll rename the files:

* `src/users/UserConcept.ts` will become `src/useridentity/UserIdentityConcept.ts`
* `src/users/UserConcept.test.ts` will become `src/useridentity/UserIdentityConcept.test.ts`

Then, I'll provide the updated content for both files.

***
