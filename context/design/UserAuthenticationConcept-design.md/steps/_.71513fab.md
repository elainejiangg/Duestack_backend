# UserAuthenticationConcept Design Notes

## Implementation Changes

### Added Actions

* **disconnectCanvas**: Added to allow users to remove Canvas OAuth tokens

### Design Rationale

The original specification included `connectCanvas` but lacked the ability to disconnect. This addition provides complete Canvas integration lifecycle management.

### Technical Implementation

* Uses MongoDB's `updateOne` with `$unset` operator to remove OAuth tokens
* Maintains session management alongside Canvas integration
* Proper validation for existing tokens before disconnection

### Testing Approach

* Tests cover successful Canvas connection and disconnection
* Validates proper error handling for non-existent users
* Ensures session management remains independent of Canvas integration

## No Major Design Changes

The core authentication concept remained faithful to the original specification, with only additive enhancements for complete Canvas integration support.
