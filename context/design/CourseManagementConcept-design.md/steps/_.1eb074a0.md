# CourseManagementConcept Design Notes

## Implementation Changes

### No Major Changes

The CourseManagement concept was implemented exactly as specified in the original design. All actions and state components match the specification perfectly.

### Technical Implementation

* Used MongoDB collections with proper indexing for course lookups
* Implemented unique constraint validation for course codes per creator
* Added global uniqueness validation for Canvas IDs
* Proper error handling for all edge cases

### Testing Approach

* Comprehensive test coverage for all CRUD operations
* Validates uniqueness constraints at both creator and global levels
* Tests Canvas ID management and validation
* Covers error cases for non-existent courses

## Design Fidelity

This concept required no design changes during implementation, demonstrating the quality of the original specification.
