# response:

I understand you've provided the structure of a concept specification and a list of concepts whose specifications I need to analyze. However, the actual content of the `*.md` concept specification files (e.g., `UserIdentityConcept.md`, `UserAuthenticationConcept.md`, etc.) has not been provided in the prompt. I only have the *links* to these files.

To generate the API documentation as requested, I need the full text content of each concept specification file.

If you provide the content of these files, I can process them according to your instructions.

For demonstration purposes, I will generate the API documentation for the `Counter` concept, which was fully described in the introductory "Structure of a concept specification" section:
