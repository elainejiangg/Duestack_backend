# UserIdentityConcept Design Notes

## Implementation Changes

### Added Actions

* **updateUserName**: Added to allow users to change their display name
* **updateUserEmail**: Added to allow users to change their email address with uniqueness validation

### Design Rationale

These additions were made to provide complete user profile management functionality. The original specification only had user creation, but real applications need the ability to update user information.

### Technical Implementation

* Used MongoDB's `updateOne` with `$set` operator for efficient updates
* Maintained email uniqueness constraint across all updates
* Proper error handling for non-existent users

### Testing Approach

* Tests cover both successful updates and error cases
* Validates uniqueness constraints are maintained
* Ensures proper error messages for invalid operations

## No Major Design Changes

The core concept remained faithful to the original specification, with only additive enhancements for user profile management.
