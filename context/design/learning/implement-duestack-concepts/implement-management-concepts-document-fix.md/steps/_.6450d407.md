### Essential Synchronizations

```
sync parse_single_upload
when DocumentManagement.uploadDocument (document: d, processedTextContent: ptc, contentUrl: cu, course: crs, fileName: fn, fileType: ft, uploader: u)
where ft is "application/pdf" or "image/png" or "text/plain" // simplified check
then SuggestionManagement.llmExtractFromDocument (user: u, documentId: d, documentContent: ptc, config: default_llm_config) // Assuming 'default_llm_config' is an implicitly available config from ExtractionConfigs

sync parse_multiple_uploads // A new sync to handle combining multiple documents
when DocumentManagement.uploadDocument (document: d1, processedTextContent: ptc1, course: crs, uploader: u) AND
     DocumentManagement.uploadDocument (document: d2, processedTextContent: ptc2, course: crs, uploader: u) // Extend 'when' for N documents as needed
then SuggestionManagement.llmExtractFromMultipleDocuments (user: u, documentIds: [d1, d2], combinedDocumentContent: (ptc1 + "\n\n" + ptc2), config: default_llm_config)

sync parse_canvas_connect
when UserAuthentication.connectCanvas (user: u, canvasOAuthToken: token)
then SuggestionManagement.parseFromCanvas (user: u, canvasData: (fetched data), config: default_canvas_config) // fetched data would come from an external Canvas API call

sync confirm_suggestion
when SuggestionManagement.confirm (suggestion: s, course: c, addedBy: u) : (course: out_c, title: t, due: d, source: src, addedBy: out_u)
then DeadlineManagement.createDeadline (course: out_c, title: t, due: d, source: src, addedBy: out_u)

sync status_update
when Request.setStatus (deadline: dl, status: st)
then DeadlineManagement.setStatus (deadline: dl, status: st)
```

### A Brief Note

The six concepts work together to support DueStackâ€™s core features while maintaining strong separation of concerns and modularity.

* **UserIdentity** manages fundamental user identities (email, name) and is purely about identity management. All actions (e.g., uploading documents, creating deadlines, updating status) are scoped by a `User` ID which originates from this concept. Update actions for user name and email have been added.
* **UserAuthentication** handles secure registration, login, and managing user credentials, including Canvas connection tokens, for existing `User` IDs from `UserIdentity`. It now includes a `disconnectCanvas` action for completeness.
* **CourseManagement** serves as containers for organizing deadlines and documents. Each course is tied to specific content and metadata, and allows both imports and manual additions. It includes full CRUD for courses and a dedicated `setCanvasId` action.
* **DeadlineManagement** is the primary planning unit in the app. Deadlines can come from Canvas imports, manual inputs, or confirmed document/image parsing. Status values help students track progress. It includes full CRUD for deadlines and `setStatus`.
* **DocumentManagement** securely stores and manages external syllabus files, GitHub tables, screenshots, and ties uploads to users and courses. It now distinguishes between `contentUrl` (for external storage) and `processedTextContent` (for LLM consumption), ensuring that large binary data is not stored in the database. Full CRUD actions for document metadata are now available.
* **SuggestionManagement** represents the result of OCR or parsing logic and must be confirmed by users before becoming official Deadlines. Canvas data also routes through this system to preserve the same confirmation pattern. Its actions have been refined to take primitive `string` content (e.g., `documentContent`, `combinedDocumentContent`) and `User` IDs, enforcing strict modularity. It also includes `ExtractionConfigs` and actions for refining and directly editing suggestions.

Generic parameters are resolved as:

* `User` always comes from the `UserIdentity` concept.
* `Course` in all references maps to `CourseManagement`.
* `Document` is an object from `DocumentManagement`.
* `SuggestionManagement.confirm` emits data for `DeadlineManagement.createDeadline` but doesnâ€™t create the Deadline itself; this is handled by a synchronization.

based on these changes? In fact provide the entirely new corrected spec
