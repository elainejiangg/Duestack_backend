# response:

Okay, let's refine your `DocumentManagement` and `SuggestionManagement` concepts, and their associated synchronizations, based on the feedback and the discussion about handling files with external storage.

The core changes will be:

1. **`DocumentManagement`:**
   * Change `fileContent: String` in the state to `contentUrl: String`.
   * The `uploadDocument` action will now simulate saving content to an external store and return a `contentUrl` and the `processedTextContent` (e.g., OCR'd text) as a string. This `processedTextContent` is what `SuggestionManagement` will consume.
   * Add `deleteDocument` and `updateDocumentMetadata` actions as per the rubric's feedback for missing actions.
   * Add `getDocumentContent` to retrieve the processed text.
2. **`SuggestionManagement`:**
   * Ensure all actions take `User`, `Document`, `Course` as generic IDs, and `documentContent` as a primitive `String` where content is passed. This aligns with modularity.
   * Add `user: User` to the `ParsedDeadlineSuggestion` state as previously identified.
   * Implement actions to accept mock LLM/parsing results for testing.
   * Refine `confirm` action to explicitly return the data for `DeadlineManagement.createDeadline`.
3. **Synchronizations:** Adjust `parse_upload` to reflect the new return values of `DocumentManagement.uploadDocument`.

I will provide the updated concept specifications, then the TypeScript implementations, and finally the test files and the trace for `DocumentManagement` and `SuggestionManagement`.

## **Updated Concept: DocumentManagement**

```concept
concept DocumentManagement [User, Course]
purpose securely store and manage various uploaded materials (e.g., syllabi, screenshots) and associate them with specific courses and users.
principle each document is uniquely identified, linked to its uploading user and associated course, and its core metadata is maintained.

state
a set of UploadedDocuments with
  a course Course
  a uploader User
  a fileName String
  a fileType String // e.g., "application/pdf", "image/png", "text/plain"
  a uploadTime DateTime
  a contentUrl String // URL where the actual file content is stored externally (e.g., GCS, S3)
  a processedTextContent String // Extracted text content from the file, suitable for LLM processing

actions
uploadDocument (course: Course, fileName: String, fileType: String, rawFileContent: String, uploader: User): (document: UploadedDocument, processedTextContent: String, contentUrl: String) or (error: String)
  requires course exists and rawFileContent is non-empty
  effects stores the rawFileContent in external storage (simulated), records its contentUrl and metadata. Simulates text extraction. Returns document ID, extracted text content, and contentUrl for further processing.

updateDocumentMetadata (document: UploadedDocument, newFileName: String, newFileType: String): Empty or (error: String)
  requires document exists
  effects updates the fileName and fileType of an existing document's metadata.

getDocumentContent (document: UploadedDocument): (processedTextContent: String) or (error: String)
  requires document exists
  effects retrieves the stored processed text content of the specified document.

deleteDocument (document: UploadedDocument): Empty or (error: String)
  requires document exists
  effects removes the specified document's metadata from the concept state and simulates deletion of its content from external storage.
```

## **Updated Concept: SuggestionManagement**

```concept
concept SuggestionManagement [User, Document, Course]
purpose represent extracted deadline candidates from documents, images, web pages, or Canvas; optionally AI-augmented.
principle suggestions are produced via an LLM from uploaded files, web pages, or Canvas data; users confirm suggestions before they become official deadlines.

state
a set of ParsedDeadlineSuggestions with
  a user User // The user who initiated the parsing
  an optional document Document // ID of the UploadedDocument if applicable
  an optional canvasMetadata String // Raw JSON data from Canvas
  an optional websiteUrl String
  a title String
  a due DateTime
  a source of SYLLABUS or IMAGE or WEBSITE or CANVAS
  an optional confirmed Boolean = false
  an optional confidence Number (0.0â€“1.0)
  an optional extractionMethod of CANVAS_JSON or LLM
  an optional provenance String // e.g., LLM model version, prompt used, file name
  an optional warnings set of String // e.g., "date ambiguous", "low confidence"

a set of ExtractionConfigs with
  a name String
  a modelVersion String
  a basePromptTemplate String
  a maxTokens Number
  a temperature Number
  a timezone String
  an optional timeout Number

actions
createExtractionConfig (name: String, modelVersion: String, basePromptTemplate: String, maxTokens: Number, temperature: Number, timezone: String, optionalTimeout: Number): (config: ExtractionConfig) or (error: String)
  requires name is unique
  effects creates a new extraction configuration for LLM processing.

parseFromCanvas(user: User, canvasData: String, config: ExtractionConfig): (suggestions: List<ParsedDeadlineSuggestion>) or (error: String)
  requires config exists and canvasData is valid JSON
  effects parses assignment JSON data, creates suggestions linked to `user`.
           sets `extractionMethod = CANVAS_JSON`, `source = CANVAS`.

llmExtractFromDocument(user: User, documentId: Document, documentContent: String, config: ExtractionConfig): (suggestions: List<ParsedDeadlineSuggestion>) or (error: String)
  requires config exists, documentId exists, documentContent is text or image suitable for LLM
  effects uses LLM to extract structured suggestions from document content, creates suggestions linked to `user`.
           sets `extractionMethod = LLM`, `confidence`, `provenance` (linking to `documentId`).

llmExtractFromMultipleDocuments(user: User, documentContents: List<{documentId: Document, content: String}>, config: ExtractionConfig): (suggestions: List<ParsedDeadlineSuggestion>) or (error: String)
  requires config exists, all documentContents are provided and suitable for LLM
  effects sends ALL document contents to LLM in SINGLE request to enable cross-referencing, creates suggestions linked to `user`.
           sets `extractionMethod = LLM`, `confidence`, `provenance` with multi-source attribution.

llmExtractFromWebsite(user: User, url: String, websiteContent: String, config: ExtractionConfig): (suggestions: List<ParsedDeadlineSuggestion>) or (error: String)
  requires config exists, url is reachable, websiteContent is non-empty
  effects uses LLM to parse website content into deadline suggestions, creates suggestions linked to `user`.
           sets `extractionMethod = LLM`, `provenance`, `confidence`.

refineWithFeedback(suggestion: ParsedDeadlineSuggestion, feedback: String, config: ExtractionConfig): (suggestion: ParsedDeadlineSuggestion) or (error: String)
  requires suggestion exists, feedback is non-empty, config exists
  effects re-prompts LLM using user feedback to refine fields of the suggestion.
           updates title, due, warnings, or confidence.

editSuggestion(suggestion: ParsedDeadlineSuggestion, newTitle: String, newDue: DateTime): Empty or (error: String)
  requires suggestion exists, newTitle is non-empty, newDue is valid
  effects updates suggestion title and due date.
           sets `warnings` to indicate manual editing.

updateSuggestionTitle(suggestion: ParsedDeadlineSuggestion, newTitle: String): Empty or (error: String)
  requires suggestion exists and newTitle is non-empty
  effects updates suggestion title.
           sets `warnings` to indicate manual editing.

updateSuggestionDate(suggestion: ParsedDeadlineSuggestion, newDue: DateTime): Empty or (error: String)
  requires suggestion exists and newDue is valid
  effects updates suggestion due date.
           sets `warnings` to indicate manual editing.

confirm (suggestion: ParsedDeadlineSuggestion, course: Course, addedBy: User): (course: Course, title: String, due: DateTime, source: SYLLABUS or IMAGE or WEBSITE or CANVAS or LLM_PARSED, addedBy: User) or (error: String)
  requires suggestion exists, is not already confirmed, has valid title and due date, and course exists
  effects marks suggestion as confirmed, and returns the data for creating a new Deadline.

### **Updated Essential Synchronizations**

```
sync parse_upload
when DocumentManagement.uploadDocument (document: d, processedTextContent: ptc, contentUrl: cu, course: crs, fileName: fn, fileType: ft, uploader: u)
where ft is "application/pdf" or "image/png" or "text/plain" // simplified check
then SuggestionManagement.llmExtractFromDocument (user: u, documentId: d, documentContent: ptc, config: default_llm_config) // Assuming 'default_llm_config' is an implicitly available config from ExtractionConfigs

sync parse_canvas
when UserAuthentication.connectCanvas (user: u, canvasOAuthToken: token) // This sync would need to trigger a periodic fetch or an explicit user action
then SuggestionManagement.parseFromCanvas (user: u, canvasData: (fetched data), config: default_canvas_config) // Assuming 'default_canvas_config' is an implicitly available config from ExtractionConfigs

sync confirm_suggestion
when SuggestionManagement.confirm (suggestion: s, course: c, addedBy: u) : (course: out_c, title: t, due: d, source: src, addedBy: out_u)
then DeadlineManagement.createDeadline (course: out_c, title: t, due: d, source: src, addedBy: out_u)

sync status_update
when Request.setStatus (deadline: dl, status: st) // Assuming 'Request' is a pseudo-concept for user requests
then DeadlineManagement.setStatus (deadline: dl, status: st)
```
