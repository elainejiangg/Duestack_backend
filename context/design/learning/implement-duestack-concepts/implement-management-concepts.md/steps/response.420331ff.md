# response:

Okay, I will update the concept specifications in `src/concepts/DueStack/DueStack-new-concepts.md` to ensure singular naming for concepts and collections, and to ensure full consistency with the provided `LikertSurvey` example's formatting, including explicit generic parameters and action result types where appropriate.

Specifically, I'll address:

1. **Concept Names:** Already updated to singular in the previous step (`UserIdentity`, `UserAuthentication`, `CourseManagement`, `DeadlineManagement`, `DocumentManagement`, `SuggestionManagement`).
2. **State Collection Names:** Ensure `a set of ...` declarations use plural names for the collections, as per standard SSF and implementation mapping (e.g., `a set of ParsedDeadlineSuggestions` instead of `a set of ParsedDeadlineSuggestion`).
3. **Generic Parameters:** Ensure they are clearly listed in the concept definition line (e.g., `concept UserAuthentication [User]`).
4. **Action Result Types:** Ensure actions explicitly state their named results and error cases (e.g., `(user: User) or (error: String)`).
5. **"A Brief Note" Section:** Ensure it reflects the singular concept names and updated descriptions.

Here are the updated concept specifications:
