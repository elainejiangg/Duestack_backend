# response:

As a large language model, I do not "browse" or "access" external documents in the same way a human does. My knowledge is based on the data I was trained on.

For this specific interaction, the context available to me is **all the text provided in the prompt you've given me**. This includes:

1. **"Why Concept Design?"** sections (introduction, what is a concept, comparison to conceptual modeling, reuse, independence, separation of concerns, completeness, composition by synchronization).
2. **"Concept Design Rubric"** (table detailing criteria, description, evidence, and example failing scenarios).
3. **"Concept State: Simple State Form"** (motivation, examples, two views, declaration structure, grammar, grammar conventions, grammar constraints, lexical considerations, key semantic features, translation into MongoDB).
4. **"Concept Design Background"** (summary of concept specification structure).
5. **"Concept Implementation"** sections (TypeScript class properties, MongoDB mapping, technology stack, steps to implementation).
6. **"Generic Parameters: managing IDs"** (ID type, freshID usage).
7. **"Creating concepts and their state"** (mapping SSF to TypeScript interfaces and collections).
8. **"Initialization"** (database connection helper).
9. **"Error handling"** (returning `{error: ...}` for non-exceptional errors).
10. **"Documentation"** (inline comments and JSDoc).
11. **"Concept Testing"** sections (what to test, steps to testing, test implementation details).
12. **The `LikertSurvey` concept specification, its TypeScript implementation, and its Deno test file** that I generated in my previous turns.

Essentially, everything you've included in the input is part of my active context for generating responses. I refer to and adhere to these guidelines and examples provided within the prompt itself.
