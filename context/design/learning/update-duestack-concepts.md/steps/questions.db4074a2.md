# questions: How do you recommend that I fix my  [@DueStack-concepts](../concepts/DueStack/DueStack-old-concepts.md) in reaction to feedback [@DueStack-initial-feedback](../concepts/DueStack/DueStack-initial-feedback.md). I also want the [@AI-Augmented-Feature-Concept](../concepts/DueStack/AI-Augmented-Feature-Concept.md) as part of my final concept design. Please make sure to adhere strictly to any guidance/rubric regarding concepts.
